*This repository will contain my lecture notes, homework from the ComIT course: Web Development with Python*

I will try my best to have extensive documentation in each of the exercises, homeworks, and will update accordingly depending on the flow of the course.

>The notes are formatted in year and day then file name.
``yyyy-mm-dd_file_name``

I made this public so that my peers can comment, provide suggestions, and have an opportunity to discuss what I have done or is currently doing.
