## Unit 1
### Practice I : Introduction to logics
---
1) Mark the link terms (if any) in the following propositions. Find how many atomic propositions are found in each
molecular proposition. Recall that << if ..., then >> is a single link term.
    1. This is not my happy day. ``(none)``
    2. Winter has come ``and`` days are shorter.
    3. Many germs are not bacteria. ``(none)``
    4. ``If`` there are flaws in large rock masses, ``then`` earthquakes may occur.
    5. ``If`` it is a positive number ``then`` it is greater than zero.
    6. ``If`` x > 0 ``then`` y = 2
    7. ``If`` x + y = 2 ``then`` z > 0
    8. x = 0 ``or`` y = 1
    9. ``If`` x = 1 o z = 2 ``then`` y > 1
    10.``If`` z > 10 then “x + z > 10” ``and`` “y + z > 10”.
    11. x + y = y + x ``(none)``

2) Recognize the propositional structure of each sentence below, to do so underline the atomic propositions, mark
the link terms and group them into molecules.
    1. The meal will be today at three o'clock. ``(none)``
    2. The big black bear walked lazily down the road. ``(none)``
    3. The music is very soft ``or`` the door is closed.
    4. This big dog likes to hunt cats. ``(none)``
    5. He asks for his pipe ``and`` asks for his bowl.
    6. ``If`` John is a good player, ``then`` he will participate in the school team.
    7. Older students are not on the list before young people. ``(none)``
    8. x + y > 2 ``(none)``
    9. x = 1 ``or`` y + z = 2
    10. y = 2 ``and`` z = 10
    11. A better world has no pollution ``(none)``
    12. Democracy only exists ``if and only if`` there are elections
    13. To defeat Voldemort``,`` Harry needs to destroy the Horcruxes.
    14. To defeat Voldemort``,`` Harry destroyed the Horcruxes.
    15. ``If`` I collect wood ``then`` I can build a ship and ``thus`` sail across the Atlantic.
    16. ``Since`` I collect wood ``then`` I can build a boat ``and``, ``if`` I build a boat ``then`` I sail to the other side of the Atlantic.

3) Idem previous exercise, only use parentheses to show the structure of the following molecular propositions.
    1. ``John is here`` and ``Mary has left.``
    2. If ``x + 1 = 10 `` then ``x = 9.``
    3. ``Mary is not here`` or ``John has left.``
    4. If (``x = 1`` or ``y = 2``) then ``z = 3``.
    5. If (``Peter is at home ``or ``John is in the courtyard``), then ``Joseph is innocent.``
    6. ``y = 0`` and ``x = 0``
    7. Doesn’t happen that ``6 = 7``
    8. Doesn’t happen that (if ``x + 0 = 10`` then ``x = 5``).

4) Let p, q, r, s, t, m, n and v be atomic propositions, to which I assign the following sentences.
        p: John traveled in the 8 A.M plane.

        q: Peter arrived on time to the airport.

        r: The project was presented to the board of directors.

        s: The flight was delayed

        t: Peter travels on the plane

        m: x + y = 0

        n: x = 2

        v: y = -2 

    Interpret the molecular propositions formed. That is, express in natural language the following propositions. Group
    by using parentheses to better recognize the precedence of operators and form a sentence.

    1. q -> ~p

        Peter arrived on time to the airport. ``then`` ``not`` John traveled in the 8 A.M plane.

        ``Peter arrived on time to the airport. Then John DID NOT travel in the 8 A.M plane``

    2. (p ^ s) -> t

        John traveled in the 8 A.M plane. ``and`` The flight was delayed ``then`` Peter travels on the plane

        ``If John traveled in the 8 A.M plane and the flight was delayed, then Peter travels on the plane.``

    3. ~q -> (~r ^ ~p )

        ``not`` Peter arrived on time to the airport. `then` `not` The project was presented to the board of directors. ``and`` `not` Peter arrived on time to the airport.

        ``If Peter DID NOT arrive on time to the airport, then project was NOT presented to the board of directors and John DID NOT travel in the 8 A.M plane.``

    4. (n ^ ñ) -> n 

        ``If`` x = 2 ``and`` x ≠ 2, ``then`` x = 2

    4. (n ^ v) -> n Alternative Answer. 

        ``If`` x = 2 ``and`` y = -2 ``then`` x = 2
