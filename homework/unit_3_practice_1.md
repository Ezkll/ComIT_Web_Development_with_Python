### Purpose of the practice
Understand concepts and achieve intelligent and practical resolution of problems. Accept multiplicity of valid responses to a problem.
Answer the following questions based on what we’ve seen in class and research if necessary.

1) What is a problem? Is it important to describe the context in which I am to solve it? How do you call the facts that we enunciate to complete the understanding of the problem? Is the problem the same for all people who analyze it? Why?

    > A **problem** can be defined as a situation, person, or thing that needs attention and needs to be dealt with or solved. It's a matter or situation regarded as unwelcome or harmful and needing to be dealt with and overcome.

    > Yes, it is important to describe the **context** in which you are to solve a problem. The context provides the circumstances that form the setting for an event, statement, or idea, and in terms of which it can be fully understood and assessed. It can include the environment, the backgrounds, the timeframe, and any other relevant factors that could influence the problem or its solution.

    > The facts that we enunciate to complete the understanding of the problem are often referred to as the **problem statement** or **problem definition**. This typically includes a description of the general issue, the specific problem that the project is trying to address, and the desired outcome or goal.

    > No, the problem is not necessarily the same for all people who analyze it. This is because people have different perspectives, experiences, and knowledge bases. What one person sees as a problem, another might not. Additionally, the same problem may require different solutions in different contexts or for different people.

    > The reason for this is rooted in the subjective nature of problems. Problems are often defined by our individual or collective perceptions, needs, and goals. Therefore, what constitutes a problem can vary greatly depending on one's perspective. This is why it's important to consider multiple viewpoints and approaches when addressing complex problems. It's also why problems often have multiple valid solutions.

2) List the steps required to resolve the following situations:
 
    #### Prepare and eat a fried egg:

    - Gather all necessary ingredients and tools: an egg, a frying pan, a spatula, oil or butter, salt, and pepper.

    - Heat the frying pan over medium heat and add a small amount of oil or butter.

    - Crack the egg into a bowl to avoid shell fragments.

    - Once the oil or butter is heated, gently pour the egg into the pan.

    - Cook the egg until the white is set but the yolk is still runny, or to your desired level of doneness.

    - Season the egg with salt and pepper.

    - Carefully remove the egg from the pan using the spatula and place it on a plate.

    - Eat the egg using appropriate utensils.
    #### Rent and watch a movie:

    - Decide on a movie you want to watch.
    - Choose a platform that offers movie rentals (like Amazon Prime, Google Play, or Apple iTunes).
    - Search for the movie on the platform.
    - Select the ‘Rent’ option and complete the payment process.
    - Once the rental is successful, you can start watching the movie.
    - Make sure to watch the movie within the rental period (usually 48 hours).
    #### Go to a movie at the theatre:

    - Decide on a movie and a suitable showtime.
    - Purchase tickets online or at the theatre box office.
    - On the day of the movie, arrive at the theatre a bit early to find your seat and buy any snacks or drinks.
    - Present your ticket at the entrance of the theatre.
    - Find your seat in the theatre.
    - Enjoy the movie and remember to be respectful to others by turning off your mobile - phone and keeping noise to a minimum.

3) Explain the steps you normally take to solve a problem.

    ``Define the Problem`` Identify the problem that needs to be solved. This could be a question that needs an answer, a task that needs to be completed, or a decision that needs to be made.

    ``Identify Relevant Information`` Determine what information is relevant to solving the problem. This could involve recognizing patterns, drawing on prior knowledge, or using logic and reasoning.

    ``Generate Possible Solutions`` Use the relevant information to generate possible solutions to the problem. This could involve creating an algorithm, developing a model, or brainstorming ideas.

    ``Evaluate Solutions`` Evaluate the possible solutions to determine which one is the best fit for the problem. This could involve testing the solutions, comparing them against each other, or assessing their feasibility.

    ``Implement the Solution`` Implement the chosen solution to solve the problem. This could involve executing the algorithm, applying the model, or carrying out the chosen idea.

    ``Review the Outcome`` Review the outcome to see if the problem has been solved. If not, return to step 1 and try again with a new approach.

4) A man found to fly in his coffee and sent his coffee back to the kitchen. When the waiter returned with a new cup of coffee, the man took a sip and immediately knew that the waiter had just removed the fly and given him back the same cup of coffee. How did the man know that he was not served a fresh cup of coffee?

    > The man could have known that he was not served a fresh cup of coffee if he had added something unique to his coffee before finding the fly. For example, if he had added a specific amount of sugar, cream, or any other condiment to his coffee, he would recognize the taste. When he took a sip from the new cup brought by the waiter, he would notice that the taste was the same as before, indicating that it was not a fresh cup of coffee.

    > The temperature of the coffee could be another way the man knew it wasn’t a fresh cup. If the coffee was not as hot as a freshly made cup should be, he could have realized that it was the same coffee he had sent back. A fresh cup of coffee would be warmer than the cup he sent back.

    > The cup may have markings inside the cup that can be seen when the man sipped the coffee.


5) Some months have 31 days, others have 30, how many have 28?

    > All months have 28 Days

6) A man is trapped in a room. The room has only two possible exits: two doors. Through the first door there is a room constructed from magnifying glass. The blazing hot sun instantly fries anything or anyone that enters. Through the second door there is a fire-breathing dragon. How does the man escape?

    > The man can escape by waiting until the sun is down and then going through the first door. When there is no sunlight, the magnifying glass would not generate heat.
